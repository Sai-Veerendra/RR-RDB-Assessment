1.First, use SELECT * from both tables and use your knowledge of queries and aggregate functions to get to know the data:
- What are the Top 25 schools (.edu domains)?
- How many .edu learners are located in New York?
- The mobile_app column contains either mobile-user or NULL. How many of these Codecademy learners are using the mobile app?

2.The data type of the sign_up_at column is DATETIME. It is for storing a date/time value in the database.
- Now, using this function, query for the sign up counts for each hour.

3.Join the two tables using JOIN and then see what you can dig out of the data!

- Do different schools (.edu domains) prefer different courses?
- What courses are the New Yorkers students taking?
- What courses are the Chicago students taking?
